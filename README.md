# QGoodWindow

*Border less window implementation for Qt 5 and Qt 6 on Windows, Linux and macOS.*

Version 2.3

#### *QGoodWindow* in dark mode on Windows 11: ![](img/qgoodwindow.png)

**QGoodWindow** gives to your application full control of the window while keeps native OS window behavior, like minimize effect.

**QGoodWindow** project is split in two modules, the  **QGoodWindow** and **QGoodCentralWidget**.

**QGoodWindow** provides the core of the project and can be used without **QGoodCentralWidget**, however **QGoodCentralWidget** offers a ready to use window with icon, title, caption buttons and a easy way to add widgets to the title bar.
